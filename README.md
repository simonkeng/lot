# LOT - Local Office Times

I want to know this for code reviews and scheduling meetings, tired or googling and/or counting, just give me the current times at each office, from the command line.

## Setup

```bash
make

# if updates were made to lot
make rebuild
```

## Usage

```bash
$ lot

~ Current Local Office Times ~
------------------------------
New York ---> 01:20 PM (13:20)
...
...

$ lot --help
...
```
